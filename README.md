# PID Controller

## Basic Idea
PID controllers calculate an error between a sensor reading and a goal (setpoint). Then it applies a correction using proportional, integral, and derivative terms (hence the name PID).

Each of the terms are multiplied by their respective "gains".

## Tuning
A PID requires "gains" for the calculations. A greay way to calculate gains is using the Zieglerâ€“Nichols method.
